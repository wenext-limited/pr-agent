# Installation

> Currently for remote suggestions, Qodo Merge has to be installed and active on your Git repository (GitHub / GitLab).

## Install Qodo Command

Qodo Merge CLI is a review tool within [Qodo Command](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command), a command-line interface for running and managing AI agents.

To use Qodo Command, you'll need first Node.js and npm installed.
Then, to install Qodo Command, run:

```bash
npm install -g @qodo/command
```

**Login and Setup**

To start using Qodo Command, you need to log in first:

```bash
qodo login
```

Once login is completed you'll receive an API key in the terminal.
The API key is also saved locally in the .qodo folder in your home dir, and can be reuused (e.g., in CI).
The key is tied to your user account and subject to the same usage limits.

[//]: # (## API Key Management)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (There are a few commands that let you maintain the API key:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (qodo key list               # List all API keys)

[//]: # (qodo key create <name>      # Create a new API key with the given name)

[//]: # (qodo key revoke <name>      # Revoke an API key by name)

[//]: # (```)


## Using Qodo Merge CLI

After you set up Qodo Command, you can start using Qodo Merge CLI by running:

```bash
qodo merge
```
### Set Up Git Client
On first run, the CLI will check for your Git client (GitHub CLI or GitLab CLI).
If not found, it will guide you through the installation process.

## Quick Usage

There are two ways to specify which PR to review:

(1) **Auto Detect PR from current branch**
run this command in your CLI:

```bash
qodo merge
```

(2) **Specify PR number or URL**

```bash
qodo merge 303

qodo merge https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/303

Then the tool will automatically fetch the suggestions from the PR and display them in an interactive table.
